# Threat Event: Credential Dumping via LSASS Access  
**Unauthorized Access to LSASS for Credential Dumping**

---

## Reason for Threat Hunt

### ðŸš¨ Recent Cybersecurity Advisory from CISA  
CISA issued a bulletin warning of increased credential theft activity leveraging tools like **Mimikatz** and **ProcDump** that target **LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)**.  
As a result, **management has directed a proactive threat hunt** to identify signs of credential dumping in the environment.

---

## Steps the "Bad Actor" Took â€“ Logs and IoCs Created

1. **Downloaded credential dumping tool**
   - E.g., `mimikatz.exe`, `debug.exe`, `procdump.exe`
   - Often disguised with benign names

2. **Disabled Security Controls (optional)**
   - Example: `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true`

3. **Executed the Credential Dump**
   - `mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"`
   - Or: `procdump.exe -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp`

4. **Extracted the Dump**
   - File: `lsass.dmp`
   - Transferred via SMB, FTP, or outbound connection

## Tables Used to Detect IoCs

| Table Name              | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DeviceProcessEvents`   | Detects execution of tools and interactions with LSASS                      |
| `DeviceFileEvents`      | Monitors creation of files like `lsass.dmp`                                 |
| `DeviceImageLoadEvents` | Tracks DLLs or suspicious modules loaded by credential dumping tools       |
| `DeviceNetworkEvents`   | Flags data exfiltration via public IPs from malicious processes             |
| `DeviceRegistryEvents`  | Detects changes to security/AV-related registry keys                        |
